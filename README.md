# LAB - 02
## “About Me” project
I build this webapage to give some basic information about who I am. This lab is about creating a project with the appropriate settings, implementing simple html, css and js into the website and interacting more with the user.

## Reflections and Comments
 * How did this go, overall? "It was great, there were some obstacles but thanks to TAs & Google every things went good."
* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?  "When we will use JS inside the html not just alert and consoleLog?!"
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?   "The actual lab took around (30-45)min, but the stretch goals took 3 hours. I gave the JS the same amount of time but the CSS took a lot of time I thought it would take 1 hour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

## Reflections and Comments
 * Put my skills in an unordered list.
 * Add my top ten books in a order list and style it.
 * Use for loops to give the user opportunities to get the correct answer.
